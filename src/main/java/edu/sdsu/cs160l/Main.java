 * TODO
 * Follow the steps listed below
 * Your programming assignment is worth 6 points this lab and easy to score
 * 1) Refer to BubbleSort and QuickSort Examples and
 *  i)      create a new class called MergeSort.java.
 *  ii)     class MergeSort must implement Sorter interface.
 *  iii)    you must implement merge sort logic (you can refer to code in zybook)
 * 2) Find TODO's in AlgorithmTimeComparators and MergeSortTest and correct it.
 * 3) For your lab report
 *  i) explain time complexity of an algorithm
 *  ii) compare time complexity of merge sort with quick sort and bubble sort
